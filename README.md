# Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic Method
## Breaking Down the 3 As
### Asynchronous
A3C has a global network with multiple agents having their own set of parameters, which creates every agentâ€™s situation interacting with its environment and harvests the experiences for overall training. This helps deal with input corelation.
### Advantage
Advantage measures the "advantage" an actor gets by taking a certain action. This is defined as Q value minus value of the state as $A(s.a) = Q(s,a) - V(s)$
